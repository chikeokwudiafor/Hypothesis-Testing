# Class-Assignments involving Hyothesis Testing
Some Assignments done while in Machine Learning Course and Data Analytics

The data contains three different measures of IQ test for individuals: FSIQ, VIQ, PIQ. For each individual, in addition to those three IQ measures, his or her gender, weight, height, and MRI. Pandas and Scipy were used to answer the following question:
1) Does VIQ and PIQ made any difference in measuring individual's IQ?
2) Does female or male have any difference in IQ, using FSIQ measure?

For each question, please clearly a) indicate your H0 and HA, b) the type of t-test, c) your interpretation of t-test results and answer to the question. You may want to see Rubrics for details as well.
1) Does VIQ and PIQ made any difference in measuring individual's IQ?
  H0: VIQ and PIQ made no difference in measing Individual's IQ
  HA: VIQ and PIQ made a difference in measuring Individual's IQ

2) The type of t-test: We are going to use Two-tail Independent t-test, first we have to check if the variances are equal to know the homogeneity. We do not however need to check for the normality since the sample size greater than 30. It is an Independent Sample Two- Tail t-test with equal variance
